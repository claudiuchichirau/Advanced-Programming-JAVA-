# Maximum Cardinality Association Determination Algorithm
## Description
This topic focuses on implementing an algorithm that determines maximum cardinality associations in a set of students and projects. We will also compare the results obtained with those of a greedy algorithm and determine a minimum cardinality set consisting of students and projects such that each admissible pair (student-project) contains at least one element from this set.

## Use
1. Make sure you have installed the required libraries such as JGraphT and Graph4J.
2. Compile and run the org.example.Main class.
3. The algorithm will generate 1500 students with random lists of projects and collect the students into a list and the projects into a set.
4. Instances of the org.example.JGraphTALgorithms and org.example.Graph4JAlgorithms classes will be created using the randomly generated data.
5. The algorithm will determine the maximum cardinality associations using JGraphT and Graph4J and display the results and execution time.
6. The algorithm will also use a greedy algorithm to determine the associations and display the results and execution time.
7. The algorithm will also determine maximum and minimum cardinality sets and display the results and execution times.
