The project consists of a student project allocation system that seeks to match a student project with an acceptable project based on their choices and project availability.

The Student class describes a student and includes their name and list of accepted projects. The Project class describes a project and includes the name of the project. Both classes implement the Comparable interface to be able to sort alphabetically by their names.

The Main class contains the main method and demonstrates the use of the Student and Project classes. In these countries it creates a list of studies and a lot of projects, then displays the names of the students and the names of the projects, both sorted alphabetically.
