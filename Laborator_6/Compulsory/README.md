This code implements a game where the user can create a graph by adding nodes and edges between them. The graph is represented by a canvas where the user can select how many edges can have the graph.

The UI of the game is created using JavaFX. The main class of the application is Main, which extends the Application class. The start method of Main creates and configures the UI elements of the game, such as the canvas, the configuration panel, and the control panel. The ConfigPanel class extends the HBox class and contains the UI elements for configuring the game, such as the number of nodes and the line probability. The DrawingPanel class extends the Canvas class and is responsible for drawing the graph and handling user interactions.

How to use:

To run the application, run the Main class. This will launch the game window, where you can interact with the canvas to create a graph. Use the configuration panel to set the number of nodes and the line probability.
